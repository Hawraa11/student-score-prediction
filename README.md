# Student Score Prediction

A predictive model that estimates students’ exam scores based on their study habits and key performance factors.

## Dataset
- Found in files

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a **linear regression model** to predict students’ final exam scores. The workflow includes:  
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
2. Exploratory data analysis and visualizations with Matplotlib.  
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, Feature Scaling.
4. Training a linear regression model to estimate final scores.  
5. Visualizing predictions and evaluating model performance using common regression metrics (RMSE, R²).
6. Making new model after removing  some features and evaluating model

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy 

## Covered Topics
- Regression  
- Model evaluation metrics  
- Data visualization  
- Feature exploration and engineering  

## Feature Experiments
- Experimented with different feature combinations to see their impact on prediction accuracy.  
- Added or removed features such as sleep hours, class participation, and study habits.  
- Observed how these changes affected predictions and evaluation metrics.
